# OpnaConf

A conference in Reykjavík, Íslands that takes a vendor-neutral approach at teaching how to teach about tech. We are targetting in summer 2021 for the first event. 

Imagine a conference where every sponsor has a fixed price and set of constraints and responsibilities all designed to sponsor a successful speaker, while also changing the life of an upcoming speaker. 

If you are interested in participating in the event please [introduce yourself](https://github.com/kris-nova/confconf/issues/new?assignees=&labels=welcome%2F2021&template=involved.md&title=Hi%2C+I+am+MY_NAME) and read the [getting involved](https://github.com/kris-nova/confconf/blob/master/README.md#getting-involved) section below.


## Getting Involved

All planning and decision making will happen here on Github in [the official issue tracker](https://github.com/kris-nova/confconf/issues).

All announcements will happen on the [official mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/confconf)


## Philosophy 

Right now events have sponsorships that can be detrimental to the quality of events by favoring those who sponsor with more capital. This new philosophy would limit all sponsorships to have the same fixed cost and receive the same benefits.

The entire event itself will be managed and governed by an open community, and with open governance. 

## Constraints of the event

There will be under *no circumstance* an opportunity to sell anything or sponsor a paid offering. Mention of tools, and employment, or an employer’s goals is certainly acceptable, but we will not allow blatant marketing efforts or publicity to revenue-driven entities. 

All sponsorships and groups will be created equal, there will be no keynotes at the event, but a small welcome session to give updates, and set expectations for the event. 

The event will be one of many events that operate under this same philosophy and with these same constraints.

## Conference groups
A group is a set of roles in the event, that all must collaborate together for their group to be successful. 

 - (Veteran) Speakers
 - (Upcoming) Speakers
 - (Sponsor) An org that is financing the group in exchange for a presence at the event

#### Veteran speakers and technologists 

This role can be thought of as a coach. Typically we would be targetting well known, and experience faces in the community. Someone who has spoken publically before, and has learned valuable information about the process.

Furthermore, this person must be willing to champion and support the rest of their group. This includes coaching their *upcoming speaker* and working directly with the *sponsor* to ensure their group is successful. 

#### Upcoming speakers and technologists 

This is a person who is willing to learn more, and have a world-class opportunity to partner with big names in the industry. There are no constraints on what defines an upcoming speaker, but the conference will define a set of criteria used to evaluate the *need* of each upcoming speaker. The conference will favor those who have the highest *need* and can demonstrate the most *value*. Such as those who have never or rarely spoken before, technical minorities, or speakers without the same opportunity at speaking or education as others in the world. *Anyone can be an upcoming speaker*.

This person must be willing to learn from their veteran coach and spend time documenting their process and their own personal journey throughout the event. 

#### Sponsors

These will be organizations or people that will be tightly coupled with both *upcoming speakers* and *veteran speakers*. There is no requirement that the sponsor needs to be anything other than an entity willing to champion their speakers and take on the financial burden for the fixed-rate sponsorship of the conference, as well as travel and lodging for both speakers in their group. 

A single sponsor can only have one group admitted to the event, and priority will be given to groups that do not have a clear connection between them. For instance, a `$company` might be accepted but their well-known `$open-source-project` will be given low priority in this case. We want to create what we consider *intentional collisions* which is where there is a healthy and balanced group of attendees at the event. 

## The CFP Process

Once a group has decided to come together they can submit a CFP for their group which will include the following information. 

Veteran Speaker 
Upcoming Speaker
Sponsor
Session title
Session quick description
The being addressed in the session
A small description of the session
A small description of the lesson or the take-away 

The CFP for the first event in Summer 2021 is not open yet, but if you are interested in documenting your interest in fulfilling a role and ultimately joining a group please [introduce yourself](https://github.com/kris-nova/confconf/issues/new?assignees=&labels=welcome%2F2021&template=involved.md&title=Hi%2C+I+am+MY_NAME).
